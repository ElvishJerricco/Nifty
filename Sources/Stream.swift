/// A lazy, asynchronous, concurrent, and reusable stream of operations on elements of data.
///
///     let sum = (1..<50000).stream()
///         .filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
///         .reduce(0, reducer: +)
///         .wait()
///
/// This example makes a stream from the collection created by `(1..<50000)`.
/// Then it filters out from that stream all elements that aren't even.
/// Then it reduces the stream; it starts at 0, then uses + to combine all elements.
/// Streams work asynchronously, so `wait()` is called to wait on the result.
///
/// There are three stages to using streams.
/// 
/// - **Create the stream**
///
///     Most often, a stream will be created using `CollectionType.stream()`, or `Stream.of(T...)`.
///     But it is possible to create custom streams.
///
///     A stream uses the `Continuation` monad to pass elements to handlers.
///     The continuation is specialized to the type `Continuation<Future<()>, T>`.
///     It returns a `Future<()>` because the handlers are asynchronous.
///     The goal is to create a continuation that will call the handler once for each element.
///     This is encouraged to be concurrent.
///     A stream shouldn't complete its future until all the futures returned by the handler are completed.
///
///     The future's type is `Future<()>` because it is isomorphic to `()`.
///     That is to say there is no actual return value.
///     The only thing that matters is the time of completion.
///
/// - **Manipulate the stream**
///
///     There are several intermediary operations to manipulate the stream.
///     The simplest is `Stream<T>.map(T -> U)`.
///     This returns a stream that maps elements of the original stream to elements of a different type.
///     
///     Streams are immutable, lazy, and reusable,
///     so intermediary operations aren't actually changing the stream or its elements.
///     Instead, they construct a new stream that will get its elements from the old stream,
///     and modify them accordingly before passing the element to a handler.
/// 
/// - **Run the stream**
///
///     Terminal operations on a stream will start running the stream.
///     Most often, the stream will run asynchronously and concurrently,
///     but this depends on the how the stream was created.
///     "Running" a stream means to start accepting elements of the stream with a handler.
///     The simplest example of this is `Stream.forEach`, which calls a handler for each element.
///
///     Most streams are concurrent. This leads to dramatic performance improvements in many scenarios.
///     There are, however, situations where the overhead of concurrency outweights the performance gains.
///     For example, there are two different methods of reducing a stream.
///     One is psuedo-serial, in that the reduction is performed serially,
///     while the elements are computed concurrently.
///     The other is fully concurrent, where both the computation of elements and the reduction are concurrent.
///     For very fast reduction functions, the psuedo-serial method is usually faster,
///     since there's no concurrency overhead.
///     For slower reduction functions, the concurrent method is usually faster,
///     since more reductions can be occurring at a time.
///
/// Streams and collections differ in several ways.
/// Besides being concurrent and asynchronous, streams are also lazy and unordered.
/// Streams do not store elements, and instead rely on abstract data sources.
/// They can't have their count calculated.
/// Most importantly, `Stream` is not a data structure.
/// It is a pipeline for manipulating elements, no matter how many there are.
/// This is the inspiration for using the `Continuation` monad.
public struct Stream<T> {
    /// The continuation that defines this `Stream`.
